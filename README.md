# hub-finder
hub-finder is a JavaScript/jQuery application that lists the nearest "hub" for a set of addresses.  It also plots the points on a Google Map.

The addresses need to be entered one per line in each form field.

Also, a Google Maps API key is required to perform the geocoding, distance matrix, and map functions.
